    <div id="culture">
        <h2>Culture/Traditions</h2>
        <p>A core aspect of Jordanian culture is hospitality. The social rule of taking care of the guest originates in
            Bedouin tradition and is deeply embedded in the Jordanian society and customs. Every Jordanian has a natural
            predisposition to being kind and hospitable toward the visitor, earning Jordan a special recognition in the
            hospitality sector. Along with the value of hospitality and generosity, Jordan has also surprisingly managed
            to preserve its cultural identity and costumes against the influence of globalization. Daily or
            occasionally, Jordanian men and women still wear traditional customs. The traditional outfit typically worn
            by men is made of a one-piece full-body covering dress, called a “Dishdashah” or “Thoub”, and a head cover
            including a white cup called “Thagiyah” and a scarf-like head cover. The women’s national custom is a
            handmade full-body covering dress usually black with embroiled red patterns. </p>
        <p>Beyond the rich traditional culture, new forms of music and arts are constantly growing, pushed by new
            generations’ need for a place to vent frustrations and concerns over the socio-political situation of the
            region, and desire to create their identity halfway between the traditional values and modernity. The
            paintings, sculptures, graffiti, and photography, in the streets, and numerous galleries and cafes of Amman,
            are all representations of Jordan’s artistic movements.</p>

    <!--section2: History-->
    <div id="history">
        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>First in record was during the Neolithic period where evidence of a settled life and growth through
            discovered artistic work suggests a well developed civilization. After that Amman was called Rabat Amon by
            the Ammonites. The Assyrians conquered it afterwards followed the Persians and then Macedonians that changed
            the name to Philadelphia, which later became part of the Nabatean Kingdom up until 106 AD when it came under
            Roman control and joined the Decapolis. Byzantine era came after and churches from this period are still
            present. Modern Jordan was founded by King Abdullah I after World War I. It was ruled by his grandson, The
            Late King Hussein, for 46 years until his death in 1999, when his son King Abdullah II assumed the throne.
            Jordan has grown into a modern nation which has enjoyed a remarkable measure of peace, stability and
            economic growth in recent decades.</p>

        <h2>Currency</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>In 1949 the country passed the Provisional Act No. 35 which created the Jordanian Currency Board
                (based in London) which then introduced the new currency in 1950. </li>
            <li>In 1992 the removing of fils and dirham from Arabic coins occur, and issuing English denominations in
                dinar and either qirsh or piastres.</li>
            <li>The first series of notes in 1949 came in ½, 1, 5, 10, and 50 dinars, but now come in 1, 5, 10, 20 and
                50 dinars. The Central Bank of Jordan took over note printing responsibility in 1959</li>

    <!--section6: Tips-->
    <div id="Tips">
        <h2>Tips/Resources</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Credit Cards and ATMs:</b> You’ll find banks, ATMs and exchange offices at the airport and in major
                shopping malls. The most widely accepted card is Visa followed by MasterCard. However, you won’t find
                ATMs in remote areas like Wadi Rum, the Dead Sea and inside Petra, so be sure to bring enough cash with
                you </li>
            <li><b>Plugs:</b> The plugs in Jordan are Type C, D, F, G, and J. The standard voltage is 230 V, and the
                standard frequency is 50Hz. I recommend buying a universal adapter (make sure it has surge protection)
                and using a converter for hairdryers and hot tools.</li>
            <li><b>Budget:</b> Jordan is surprisingly one of the more expensive destinations I’ve ever traveled. You
                won’t find a well-paved tourist route, in the sense that there aren’t boutique hotels or tons of
                options. So, I find that staying at 5-star resorts tends to be the most comfortable and things can get
                quite expensive. You’ll also find accommodations are pretty expensive and you don’t have ton of options
                in places like Petra or the Dead Sea. Most places run around $150-$200 a night</li>
