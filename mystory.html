            <p><b>Welcome!!</b> I appreciate you stopping by!! My name is Marwa Abdulqader and I’m 19 years old. I was
                born in
                Baghdad, Iraq and was raised in Damascus, Syria and now I’m residing in Arizona, United States. I moved
                from
                Iraq to Syria due to the war in Iraq and the downfall of president Saddam Hussein in 2005. Then, I moved
                from Syria to the United State in 2013 due to civil war emerging in Syria. I’ll start with the name of
                this
                site because it can be confusing. A coincidence traveler is someone who traveled and moved to many
                countries
                but without the intention of tourism. I’m a coincidence traveler because I have traveled and moved to
                many
                countries due to the wars in the Middle East and not for the intention of tourism. I appreciate having
                the
                opportunity to travel and explore different cultures, meeting new people, and learning different
                languages.
            </p>

            <h1>How did I get started?</h1>
            <hr> <img id="HM1" src="j2.jpg">
            <p>I started when I was in Syria during (2005-2013). In Syria, I have moved to multiple regions and cities
                due
                to constant war zones and expansion. However, for that reason I was able to see, explore, meet beautiful
                and
                exceptional places and people. In Syria, I have lived in the rural areas near orchards, fields full of
                fruits, green plains, mountains, and water springs. For me, the most important element was the Syrian
                people
                who were loving, cheerful, satisfied and full of activity and energy.</p>
            <p> In 2009, I have traveled to Jordan and had the opportunity to visit rich historical places. Jordan was
                rich
                in it culture, people, and history. Jordanian people love their land and their country as it is a part
                of
                them. They are the most generous, hospitable, helpful, life-loving and laughing people. Traces of their
                history and civilizations can be sensed and seen in their homes, streets, landmarks, and cities. </p>
            <p>In 2011, I traveled to Turkey from Syria. Turkey is famous and know for it incredible wonders castle,
                mosques, bazzars, geographical locations, and tasty food. Turkey is a unique mixture of it kind between
                the
                Middle East and Europe. It is a different and unique mixture that brings together two cultures and make
                every person regardless of their culture and background feel a sense of belonging.</p>
