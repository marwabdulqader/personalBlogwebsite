            <hr> <img id="SY" alt="  Syrian dancing traditions" src="ts1.jpg">
            <p>As is evidenced by the country’s history, the Syria we know today is an eclectic mix of different
                cultures
                that have influenced Syrian culture throughout the centuries. Whether Turkish, Mediterranean, Arab or
                French, various influences can be clearly seen in such cultural markers as cuisine, music and festivals.
                Syrian cuisine is exciting and not only culturally varied but regionally as well. Most regions have
                their
                own signature dish which makes for a mouth watering travel experience. The most dominant influences by
                far,
                however, are Greek, Southern Mediterranean and South West Asian. Such foods as hummus, falafel, grilled
                meat
                kebabs and mujaddara (a rice, lentil and onion dish), and sweet pastries are examples these influences.
                Syrian festivals, if nothing else, perfectly display the many cultures and religions it took to make the
                modern Syria of today. The country celebrates such religious festivals as the Christian Easter but also
                the
                Islamic Ramadan and Edi al-Fitr. There are also events like the Silk Road Festival which hark back to
                the
                days when Syria was an important trade route between the East and the West.

            <p>This sought-after land was occupied by all sorts of ancient empires—the Egyptians, Hittites, Sumerians,
                Mitanni, Assyrians, Babylonians, Canaanites, Phoenicians, Arameans, Amorites, Persians, and eventually,
                Greeks with the conquest of Alexander the Great (‘Syria’ means ‘formerly Assyria’ in ancient Greek, and
                it’s
                assumed this is when the area was given its name). Several hundred years later, Pompey the Great
                captured
                the Greek capital of Antioch (now part of Turkey, but what was once Syria), turning it into a Roman
                province.</p>

            <p>The young state did not last long, however, because in the same year Syria fell under the French mandate,
                which thwarted the dinar and imposed a new currency on the country by installing the Bank of Syria.
                The new currency unit was the pound (or lira), equivalent to 100 piasters. It was only when Syria gained
                independence in 1946 that it was able to free the financial system from France and, through the
                subsequent establishment of the Central Bank of Syria, to exercise monetary sovereignty and issue
                money independently. The monetary system of the mandate was thereby adopted for the new money.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Syria is not really a country where you have to worry about your expenses too much. As a result, it
                    is
                    quite easy for a single traveler to visit Syria on $25 USD / day. </li>
                <li>The Syrian Pound has devalued massively. Today, travelers are exchanging 1USD = 1200SYP, so Syria
                    just
                    got double cheaper</li>
                <li>ATMs and Credit Cards – Because of the sanctions, everything is blocked in Syria, so you must bring
                    enough cash for your whole stay.</li>
                <li>4) Don’t say anything bad about Al-Assad (president) You will be surprised to know that most people
                    are
                    heavy supporters of the Al-Assad regime, so don’t give your political opinion because you may offend
                    someone.
                    I guess that the Syrians who are against him aren’t there anymore.</li>
