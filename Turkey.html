            <h2>Culture/Traditions</h2>
            <p>Turkey has a very diverse culture that is a blend of various elements of the Oğuz Turkic and Anatolian,
                Ottoman (which was itself a continuation of both Greco-Roman and Islamic cultures), and Western culture
                and
                traditions which started with the Westernization of the Ottoman Empire and continues today. This mix is
                a
                result of the encounter of Turks and their culture with those of the peoples who were in their path
                during
                their migration from Central Asia to the West. As Turkey successfully transformed from the
                religion-based
                former Ottoman Empire into a modern nation-state with a very strong separation of state and religion, an
                increase in the methods of artistic expression followed. During the first years of the republic, the
                government invested a large amount of resources into fine arts, such as museums, theatres, and
                architecture.
                Because of different historical factors playing an important role in defining the modern Turkish
                identity,
                Turkish culture is a product of efforts to be "modern" and Western, combined with the necessity felt to
                maintain traditional religious and historical values.</p>

            <h2>History</h2>
            <p> The Republic was proclaimed on October 29, 1923. For the first time in centuries, the Turkish people
                enjoyed
                self-rule. Mustafa Kemal was elected as the first president of the Republic of Turkey. As president for
                15
                years, until his death in 1938, Mustafa Kemal Atatürk introduced a broad range of reforms in the
                political,
                social, legal, economic, and cultural spheres that were virtually unparalleled in any other country.
                Turkish
                women received equal rights under the law such as the right to vote and be elected to public office,
                which
                put Turkey ahead of many Western nations in terms of women's rights. It was a revolution, unparalleled
                at
                its time and even today, to bring a predominantly Muslim nation in line with Western civilization and
                universal values</p>

            <p>Turkey used the Turkish Lira, until 1794 France had the French livre, up till 2002 Italy adapted the

                lira, and The United Kingdom had the British pound which still abbreviated with “LB”.
                By 1844, The Ottoman Empire introduced the Ottoman Lira to be the official currency of the ottoman land,
                keeping the kuruş as a 1⁄100 subdivision. Nowadays, The Turkish Lira banknote got the portraits of
                Mustafa
                Kemal Atatürk, the founder of the modern Turkish Republic. In 2019, the Turkey currency rates reached 1
                TRY
                = 0.17 USD and 1 TRY = 0.16 EUR.</p>
